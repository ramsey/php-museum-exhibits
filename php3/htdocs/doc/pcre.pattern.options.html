	  matches only at the start of the string, while the "end of
	  line" metacharacter ($) matches only at the end of the
	  string, or before a terminating newline (unless
	  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

>	  When this option is set, the "start of line" and "end of
	  line" constructs match immediately following or immediately
	  before any newline in the subject string, respectively, as
	  well as at the very start and end. This is equivalent to
	  Perl's /m option. If there are no "\n" characters in a
	  subject string, or no occurrences of ^ or $ in a pattern,
	  setting this option has no effect.

	  complicated patterns. Note, however, that this applies only
	  to data characters. Whitespace characters may never appear
	  within special character sequences in a pattern, for example
