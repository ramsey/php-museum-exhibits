>&#13;    PHP is capable of receiving file uploads from any RFC-1867
    compliant browser (which includes Netscape Navigator 3 or later,
    Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 with a patch from Microsoft, or
    later without a patch).  This feature lets people upload both text
    and binary files.  With PHP's authentication and file manipulation
    functions, you have full control over who is allowed to upload and
    what is to be done with the file once it has been uploaded.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    Note that PHP also supports PUT-method file uploads as used by
    Netscape Composer and W3C's Amaya clients.  See the <A
HREF="features.file-upload.put-method.html"
>PUT Method
    Support</A
> for more details.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    A file upload screen can be built by creating a special form which
    looks something like this:
    <TABLE
WIDTH="100%"
BORDER="0"
CELLPADDING="0"
CELLSPACING="0"
CLASS="EXAMPLE"
><TR
><TD
><DIV
CLASS="example"
><A

></P
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;&#60;FORM ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" ACTION="_URL_" METHOD=POST&#62;
&#60;INPUT TYPE="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="1000"&#62;
Send this file: &#60;INPUT NAME="userfile" TYPE="file"&#62;
&#60;INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send File"&#62;
&#60;/FORM&#62;
     </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></DIV
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
    The _URL_ should point to a PHP file.  The MAX_FILE_SIZE hidden
    field must precede the file input field and its value is the
    maximum filesize accepted.  The value is in bytes.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    In PHP 3, the following variables will be defined within the
    destination script upon a successful upload, assuming that <A
HREF="configuration.html#ini.register-globals"
>register_globals</A
> is turned
    on in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>php.ini</TT
>. If <A
HREF="configuration.html#ini.track-vars"
>track_vars</A
> is turned on, they will
    also be available within the global array
    <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$HTTP_POST_VARS</TT
>. Note that the following
    variable names assume the use of the file upload name 'userfile',
    as used in the example above:

    <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;       <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$userfile</TT
> - The temporary filename in which
       the uploaded file was stored on the server machine.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;       <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$userfile_name</TT
> - The original name or path
       of the file on the sender's system.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;       <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$userfile_size</TT
> - The size of the uploaded
       file in bytes.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;       <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$userfile_type</TT
> - The mime type of the file
       if the browser provided this information.  An example would be
       "image/gif".
      </P
></LI
></UL
>
    Note that the "$userfile" part of the above variables is
    whatever the name of the INPUT field of TYPE=file is in the upload
    form.  In the above upload form example, we chose to call it
    "userfile"
   </P
><P
>&#13;    In PHP 4, the behaviour is slightly different, in that the new
    global array <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$HTTP_POST_FILES</TT
> is provided to
    contain the uploaded file information. This is still only
    available if <A
HREF="configuration.html#ini.track-vars"
>track_vars</A
> is
    turned on, but <A
HREF="configuration.html#ini.track-vars"
>track_vars</A
> is
    always turned on in versions of PHP after PHP 4.0.2.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    The contents of <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$HTTP_POST_FILES</TT
> are as
    follows. Note that this assumes the use of the file upload name
    'userfile', as used in the example above:
    <P
></P
><DIV

><DL

><TT
CLASS="varname"

       </P
></DD
><DT
><TT
CLASS="varname"
>$HTTP_POST_FILES['userfile']['type']</TT
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;        The mime type of the file, if the browser provided this
        information.  An example would be
        <TT
CLASS="literal"
>"image/gif"</TT
>.
        </P
></DD
><DT
><TT
CLASS="varname"
>$HTTP_POST_FILES['userfile']['size']</TT

>&#13;        The size, in bytes, of the uploaded file.
       </P

><DT
><TT
CLASS="varname"

></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;        The temporary filename of the file in which the uploaded file
        was stored on the server.
       </P
></DD

   </P
><P
>&#13;    Files will by default be stored in the server's default temporary
    directory, unless another location has been given with the <A
HREF="configuration.html#ini.upload-tmp-dir"
>upload_tmp_dir</A
> directive in
    <TT

>&#13;    The PHP script which receives the uploaded file should implement
