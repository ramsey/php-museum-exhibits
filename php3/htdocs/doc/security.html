>&#13;   PHP is a powerful language and the interpreter, whether included
   in a web server as a module or executed as a separate
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>CGI</SPAN
> binary, is able to access files, execute
   commands and open network connections on the server.  These
   properties make anything run on a web server insecure by default.
   PHP is designed specifically to be a more secure language for
   writing CGI programs than Perl or C, and with correct selection of
   compile-time and runtime configuration options it gives you
   exactly the combination of freedom and security you need.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   As there are many different ways of utilizing PHP, there are many
   configuration options controlling its behaviour.  A large
   selection of options guarantees you can use PHP for a lot of
   purposes, but it also means there are combinations of these
   options and server configurations that result in an insecure
   setup.  This chapter explains the different configuration option
   combinations and the situations they can be safely used.

>&#13;     Using PHP as a <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>CGI</SPAN
> binary is an option for
     setups that for some reason do not wish to integrate PHP as a
     module into server software (like Apache), or will use PHP with
     different kinds of CGI wrappers to create safe chroot and setuid
     environments for scripts.  This setup usually involves installing
     executable PHP binary to the web server cgi-bin directory.  CERT
     advisory <A
HREF="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-96.11.interpreters_in_cgi_bin_dir.html"
TARGET="_top"
>CA-96.11</A
> recommends
     against placing any interpreters into cgi-bin.  Even if the PHP
     binary can be used as a standalone interpreter, PHP is designed
     to prevent the attacks this setup makes possible:

>&#13;       The path information part of the url after the PHP binary name,

       conventionally used to specify the name of the file to be
       opened and interpreted by the <SPAN

       Usually some web server configuration directives (Apache:
       Action) are used to redirect requests to documents like
       <TT
CLASS="filename"
>http://my.host/secret/script.php3</TT
> to the
       PHP interpreter.  With this setup, the web server first checks
       the access permissions to the directory <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/secret</TT
>, and after that creates the
       redirected request <TT
CLASS="filename"
>http://my.host/cgi-bin/php/secret/script.php3</TT
>.
       Unfortunately, if the request is originally given in this form,
       no access checks are made by web server for file <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/secret/script.php3</TT
>, but only for the
       <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/cgi-bin/php</TT
> file.  This way
       any user able to access <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/cgi-bin/php</TT

       protected document on the web server.

>&#13;     If your server does not have any content that is not restricted
     by password or ip based access control, there is no need for
     these configuration options.  If your web server does not allow
     you to do redirects, or the server does not have a way to
     communicate to the PHP binary that the request is a safely
     redirected request, you can specify the option <A
HREF="install.configure.html#install.configure.enable-force-cgi-redirect"
>--enable-force-cgi-redirect</A

     neither by directly <TT
CLASS="filename"
>http://my.host/cgi-bin/php/dir/script.php3</TT

     Instead, PHP will only parse in this mode if it has gone through

     relies on Apache to set the non-standard CGI environment variable
     <TT

>REDIRECT_STATUS</TT

     web server does not support any way of telling if the request is
     direct or redirected, you cannot use this option and you must use
     one of the other ways of running the CGI version documented
     here.

><P
>&#13;     To include active content, like scripts and executables, in the
     web server document directories is sometimes consider an insecure
     practice.  If, because of some configuration mistake, the scripts
     are not executed but displayed as regular HTML documents, this
     may result in leakage of intellectual property or security
     information like passwords.  Therefore many sysadmins will prefer
     setting up another directory structure for scripts that are
     accessible only through the PHP CGI, and therefore always
     interpreted and not displayed as such.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Also if the method for making sure the requests are not
     redirected, as described in the previous section, is not
     available, it is necessary to set up a script doc_root that is
     different from web document root.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     You can set the PHP script document root by the configuration
     directive <A
HREF="configuration.html#ini.doc-root"
>doc_root</A
> in the
     <A
HREF="configuration.html#configuration.file"
>configuration file</A
>, or
     you can set the environment variable
     <TT
CLASS="envar"
>PHP_DOCUMENT_ROOT</TT
>.  If it is set, the CGI version
     of PHP will always construct the file name to open with this
     <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>doc_root</I
></TT
> and the path information in the
     request, so you can be sure no script is executed outside this
     directory (except for <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>user_dir</I
></TT
>
     below).
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Another option usable here is <A
HREF="configuration.html#ini.user-dir"
>user_dir</A
>.  When user_dir is unset,
     only thing controlling the opened file name is
     <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>doc_root</I
></TT
>.  Opening an url like <TT
CLASS="filename"
>http://my.host/~user/doc.php3</TT
> does not
     result in opening a file under users home directory, but a file
     called <TT
CLASS="filename"
>~user/doc.php3</TT
> under
     doc_root (yes, a directory name starting with a tilde
     [<TT
CLASS="literal"
>~</TT
>]).
    </P
><P
>&#13;     If user_dir is set to for example <TT
CLASS="filename"
>public_php</TT
>, a request like <TT
CLASS="filename"
>http://my.host/~user/doc.php3</TT
> will open a
     file called <TT
CLASS="filename"
>doc.php3</TT
> under the directory
     named <TT
CLASS="filename"
>public_php</TT
> under the home
     directory of the user.  If the home of the user is <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/home/user</TT
>, the file executed is
     <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/home/user/public_php/doc.php3</TT
>.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>user_dir</I
></TT
> expansion happens regardless of
     the <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>doc_root</I

     the document root and user directory access
     separately.

>Case 4: PHP parser outside of web tree</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;     A very secure option is to put the PHP parser binary somewhere
     outside of the web tree of files.  In <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/local/bin</TT
>, for example.  The only real
     downside to this option is that you will now have to put a line
     similar to:

></TD
></TR
></TABLE

></P
></DIV
>
     as the first line of any file containing PHP tags.  You will also
     need to make the file executable.  That is, treat it exactly as
     you would treat any other CGI script written in Perl or sh or any
     other common scripting language which uses the
     <TT
CLASS="literal"
>#!</TT
> shell-escape mechanism for launching
     itself.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     To get PHP to handle <TT

>PATH_INFO</TT
> and
     <TT
CLASS="envar"
>PATH_TRANSLATED</TT

     setup, the php parser should be compiled with the <A
