>    PHP is a powerful language and the interpreter, whether included
    in a web server as a module or executed as a separate
    <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CGI</SPAN
> binary, is able to access files, execute
    commands and open network connections on the server.  These
    properties make anything run on a web server insecure by default.
    PHP is designed specifically to be a more secure language for
    writing CGI programs than Perl or C, and with correct selection of
    compile-time and runtime configuration options it gives you
    exactly the combination of freedom and security you need.

   </P
><P
>    As there are many different ways of utilizing PHP, there are many
    configuration options controlling its behaviour.  A large
    selection of options guarantees you can use PHP for a lot of
    purposes, but it also means there are combinations of these
    options and server configurations that result in an insecure
    setup.  This chapter explains the different configuration option
    combinations and the situations they can be safely used.

      setups that for some reason do not wish to integrate PHP as a
      module into server software (like Apache), or will use PHP with
      different kinds of CGI wrappers to create safe chroot and setuid
      environments for scripts.  This setup usually involves
      installing executable PHP binary to the web server cgi-bin
      directory.  CERT advisory <A

>CA-96.11</A
>
      recommends agains placing any interpreters into cgi-bin.  Even
      if the PHP binary can be used as a standalone interpreter, PHP
      is designed to prevent the attacks this setup makes possible:

	redirected request <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>http://my.host/cgi-bin/php/secret/script.php3</TT

	Unfortunately, if the request is originally given in this

	<TT

	for the <TT

>      If your server does not have any content that is not restricted
      by password or ip based access control, there is no need for
      these configuration options.  If your web server does not allow
      you to do redirects, or the server does not have a way to
      communicate with the PHP binary that the request is a safely
      redirected request, you can specify the option <A
HREF="install-unix.html#ENABLE-FORCE-CGI-REDIRECT"
>--disable-force-cgi-redirect</A
>
      to the configure script.  You still have to make sure your PHP
      scripts do not rely on one or another way of calling the script,
      neither by directly <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>http://my.host/cgi-bin/php/dir/script.php3</TT

      nor by redirection <TT

      Instead, PHP will only parse in this mode if it has gone through
      a web server redirect rule.
     </P
><P

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>Action php3-script /cgi-bin/php
AddHandler php3-script .php3</PRE

      relies on Apache to set the non-standard CGI environment
      variable <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>REDIRECT_STATUS</TT
> on redirected requests.
      If your web server does not support any way of telling if the
      request is direct or redirected, you cannot use this option and
      you must use one of the other ways of running the CGI version
      documented here.

><P
>      To include active content, like scripts and executables, in the
      web server document directories is sometimes consider an
      insecure practice.  If for some configuration mistake the
      scripts are not executed but displayed as usual HTML documents,
      this may result in leakage of intellectual property or security
      information like passwords.  Therefore many sysadmins will
      prefer setting up another directory structure for scripts that
      is only accessible through the PHP CGI, and therefore always
      interpreted and not displayed as such.
      
     </P
><P
>      Also if the method for making sure the requests are not
      redirected, as described in the previous section, is not
      available, it is necessary to set up a script doc_root that is
      different from web document root.

      directive <A

      <A
HREF="configuration.html#PHP3.INI"
>php3.ini</A

      the environment variable <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PHP_DOCUMENT_ROOT</TT

      it is set, the CGI version of PHP will always construct the file
      name to open with this <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>doc_root</I
></TT
> and the
      path information in the request, so you can be sure no script is
      executed outside this directory (except for
      <TT

      only thing controlling the opened file name is
      <TT

><I
>doc_root</I

CLASS="FILENAME"
>http://my.host/~user/doc.php3</TT

      result in opening a file under users home directory, but a file
      called <TT

>~user/doc.php3</TT

      doc_root (yes, a directory name starting with a tilde
